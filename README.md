 Gizmo year 2 Design Engineering - GigaSketch

 There are two files associated with this project.
 The first one is used with an arduino which controlls the main element of the device.
 It takes inputs from two rotary encoders and stopper switches.
 It then outputs movement of two stepper motors, a LCD screen and 2 LED lights.

 These interactions are used to move a ball around a zone as well as have a built in game element similar to mine sweeper / marco-polo

 The seccond file contains code to be run on Bela.
 This takes the input of a piezo disk which is taped onto the back of a real etch-a-sketch.
 When stimulated above the threshold value, it spins a dc motor which vibrates the table to reset the sand.

 Circuit diagrans are also added to the repository.

 Feel free to have a go at making your own gigasketch and use my code for inspiration.
